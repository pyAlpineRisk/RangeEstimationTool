# Range-Estimation-Tool
In the specific example of estimating range using a flat-rate slope approach, a rough delineation of the range of landslide processes is calculated using Python and QGIS, incorporating GIS and terrain analyses.

<p> The QGIS Change Detetcion Tool(QCD) is an an open-source python-based change detection tool for raster formats designed for QGIS. The tool is used to calculate an accurate change detection by determine and visualise reliable surface- and volume changes in multi-temporal DTMs.</p> 

<h2>Installation/Application</h2>
<p>The scripts are written for PyQGIS 3.16 and can be used by installing QGIS 3.16 or above.

To install QGIS tools developed for QGIS 3.x, copy them into
~/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/processing/scripts or in the upper part of the toolbox dialog you can add the scripts with ![mIconPythonFile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52344347/136413201-b4a1f7d3-4053-4aa6-b11c-9433ae617057.png) Scripts - Add Script to Toolbox ...

After that the tools can be found in the QGIS "Processing Toolbox" - Scripts</p>
